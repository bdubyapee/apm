Another Python MUD
===

Another Python MUD (APM), is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) engine written in Python.  The design is
loosely based on the original merc/diku/ROM style of MUDs.  The purpose is to create a general
use MUD that offers features not found in other similiarly styled games.

What is a MUD?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD
What is Python? http://www.python.org/


Current Python Development Version: Python 3.3.0a3.
I develop on Windows 7 currently.  You will need to modify world.py to match your OS/setup.
There is also a WingIDE project file in the /src folder if you happen to use Wing. 


Start by running apm.py.  You should then be able to telnet to localhost port 4000.  I
recomend PuTTY as a telnet client as that is the one I use to test with.  Any 'non-windows'
telnet client should work, however I haven't tested many of them.

There is a generic admin character already created:
Username: newadmin
Password: password
